1. Build a web page that accepts ALL customer order details for a fully customisable product (e.g. t-shirt or MUG) 
and successfully sends all the required data to the specified PHP server http://atlantis.cit.ie/displayvalues.php. 
The data sent should include everything needed for a third party to create the customisable product and to ship it to the customer! Payment details/methods are not required. 
Note: If the form is submitted correctly you should be able to see the variables listed on the php webpage listed above. No data should be sent to the server until all the required input has been entered and validated. 
2. Demonstrate the ability to provide user feedback by using JavaScript to modify the appearance of form elements using the Document Object Model or jQuery. 
3. Demonstrate the ability to use built-in HTML5 features for the validation of user input and provide user feedback through the use of CSS pseudo classes. 
4. Demonstrate the ability to dynamically visualise the customisable product being ordered while being specified. Allow the user to select from one of (at least) 5 pre-defined style combinations. 
5. Dynamically display accurate price information while the order is being specified. E.g.: For a customisable t-shirt, the user should be able to modify (at a minimum) the size, colour, graphic, and text displayed on the t-shirt.
6. Demonstrate the ability to apply a discount if certain conditions are met (e.g. user has mycit.ie email address).
